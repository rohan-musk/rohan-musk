##Hi! This is Rohan
#####Student from BITS Pilani, pursuing Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering

I have spent the last few years learning new skills when academics couldn't quench my thirst to learn something new. Learning graphic designing, 3dmodelling and understanding how social media marketing works have been some of the things that helped me quench my thirst for a while. Now in order to increase my skills, I have decided to venture out and learn coding.

Skills I am good at-
*Photoshop
*Illustrator
*Blender

Skills I am planning to improve upon this year-
*Frontend Web Dev
*Game dev
*App Dev
*UI/UX

Feel free to contact me to discuss about favourite anime :stuck_out_tongue: on-
